I have been in the IT field for over *twelve* years now. In that time, I have worked various roles from desktop support, to junior through principal system administrator, IT manager, and even as a security engineer. What I've learned over these years is that I ***love learning***. I'm currently halfway through my Bachelor's degree in IT at UMass Lowell as of this past summer semester. I have found it difficult to work full-time, do classes part-time, and also study for certifications/work in my home lab. With the state of the world currently, I am allowing myself to not feel bad about struggling with balancing these.

I was recently very inspired by [Josh Duffney](https://twitter.com/joshduffney) due to his ability to overcome his imposter syndrome and how he has taken control of his own career. After reflecting on these things, as well as beginning to read Josh's book: [become Ansible](https://gumroad.com/l/become-ansible), I am now pushing myself to rebuild my home lab. The lab will include utilizing AWS and Azure as well as on-premises hardware to simulate hybrid cloud environments. I will also be incorporating Terraform and Ansible into the build and management of the lab. 

I will continue to document my progress here, both of my home lab build, and my overall learning progression. So keep an eye out for updates coming soon!
