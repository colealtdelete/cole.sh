### Hey there, I'm Cole :wave:

I've worked in IT for over a decade in various roles from desktop support, sysadmin, management, and currently as security engineer with a focus on cloud.

### I :heart_eyes: Automation & Security

I caught the "automation bug" a few years back when diving into PowerShell. These days I spend most of my time in VSCode and now branching out to other languages such as Python and Javascript. I also enjoy working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and configuration management with [Ansible](https://www.ansible.com/). 

I truly enjoy combing my love for automation with my deep interest in information security to build processes and systems that are flexible, resilient, and secure.

### etc.
I live in the Boston metro area with my partner and our cat Frickles. I'm a student at UMass Lowell and currently working on completing my [Bachelor's in IT](https://gps.uml.edu/degrees/undergrad/online-bachelors-information-technology-degree.cfm). In my free time, I can be found exploring my neighborhood with my partner :round_pushpin: , eating my favorite foods :sushi: :taco: :pizza: , reading books :book: , playing video games :video_game: , or trying to sharpen my red team skills on [HackTheBox](https://hackthebox.eu) or [TryHackMe](https://tryhackme.com/) :computer:
