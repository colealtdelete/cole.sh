### Hey there, I'm Cole :wave:

I've worked in IT for over a decade in various roles from desktop support, sysadmin, infosec, management, and currently as Senior Systems Engineer.

### I :heart_eyes: Automation & Security

I caught the "automation bug" a few years back when diving into PowerShell. These days I spend most of my time in VSCode and now branching out to other languages such as Python and Go. I also enjoy working with Infrastructure as Code (IaC) with [Terraform](https://www.terraform.io/) and very interested in working with Kubernetes and Crossplane. 

I truly enjoy combing my love for automation with my deep interest in information security to build processes and systems that are flexible, resilient, and secure.
